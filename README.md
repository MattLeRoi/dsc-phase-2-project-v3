# Aircraft Safety Analysis

**Author**: [Matt LeRoi](mailto:mcleroi@gmail.com) 

# Business Understanding

The goal of this project is to assess the accident risk of small aircraft for business/private use. The client is new to the business of operating aircraft and wants to minimize risk. This also includes focusing on the most common aircraft and newer planes to reduce the number of unknowns that would arise from lesser-used aircraft and the potential for incomplete maintenance records. The client will receive a targeted list of the safest aircraft to analyze further - for cost, number of seats, fuel efficiency, or other factors outside of the scope of this analysis - before making a final purchasing decision.

# Data Understanding

This project uses two data sources: [accident data](./data/Aviation_Data.csv) and [aircraft registration data](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) from the FAA. The accident data, "data.csv", includes a unique entry for each accident or incident recorded, along with the number of injuries, fatalites, etc., information about the aircraft involved, and the circumstances around the event. The registration data contains a unique entry for each aircraft registered in the US and will be used to count the number of each make and model in operation. 

## Data Preparation

The large files are trimmed of unecessary information and formatted in a consistent manner to be merged later.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The accident and registration data are merged, and rates of fatalities, injuries, occurrences of issues, etc. are calculated and displayed.

# Conclusion

The rates of aircraft issues varied greatly from aircraft to aircraft. Within the top 10 most common single and dual engine aircraft, the rates varied from 5 occurrances per 1000 registered aircraft to 25.

There were no significantly noted differences in accident rates between single and dual engine aircraft. The number of people affected was different, however, due to the generally larger seating capacity of dual engine planes.

## Limitations

The available data only provide the number of incidents, severity of injuries, and number of aircraft registered. Many other factors pertaining to the incidents could provide more detail about which incidents were related to the aircraft and which were pilot error, weather related, or otherwise independent of the aircraft. Also, the registration data seems a reasonable factor for normalizing incident counts, but number of hours or miles flown would be a more accurate normalization factor. 

## Recommendations

The following aircraft are recommended for further study:

Single engine aircraft:
- CIRRUS DESIGN SR22T
- PIPER PA-28-180
- PIPER PA-28-181

Dual engine aircraft:
- BD-100-1A10
- LEARJET INC 45
- BEECH 95-B55 (T42A)
- PIPER PA-23-250

## Next Steps

The recommended aircraft should be further analyzed for other factors, including:
- Acquisition cost
- Maintenance cost
- Fuel cost
- Staffing requirements
- Lifetime of aircraft / performance over time
- Availability of pilots and crew
- Seating capacity
